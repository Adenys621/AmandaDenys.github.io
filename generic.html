									<h1>A little section about me<br />
									</h1>
									<p>I have 10 years of experience managing multiple departments and nearly two years of experience training autonomous vehicles.
									   During this time I worked in the 2D & 3D space from data annotating on maps, performing quality control on thousands of clips 
									   and root cause analysis for on road behaviors. </p>

								<p>Hello, I see you have found my portfolio.</p>
								<p>I want to take a little time to talk about who I am and how I decided to start learning about becoming a Data Analyst. Let’s go back in time to my first job. I started working at 
									Pinnacle solutions a local printing press in Modesto. I had no experience but always had the excitement to learn and grow. I started doing small tasks 
									for the company such as folding those little labels that go around plant pots that tell you want variety it is. After some time, I sat down with the plant 
									manager and we discussed me moving up to take over the Mailing Department. This was my first taste in working with data. I had no idea what excel was or 
									how to remove duplicates. I ran into a problem you see... The previous employee left abruptly so I was on my own. I began looking into this outside of work 
									so that I could become even more accurate and quicker. On top of learning all about data I also had to learn about mail and the equipment that it was ran on. 
									Over the years I quickly learned all the ins and outs of excel and postal data software and began to really enjoy what I was doing.
							 </p>
							 </p>   After a couple of years, I moved onto another company that focused more on mailing. This is where I first started in a data only position. I quickly 
							 		moved up and became the department manager where I trained many employees to clean, prep and process the data. I held that position for a while until 
									the print department manager decided to leave the company. The CEO had been watching my career progression with the company and asked if I would be 
									interested. Again, I was so eager to learn and grow and never ran digital printers or really worked with programmers. I had to quickly learn all the 
									processes that included maintaining printers, paper and internal programming all while still running the data department. I worked with the CEO, and we 
									decided to merge the two departments since they both worked so closely, so I began cross training. This is where I really fell in love with working with 
									data. I was able to get more hands on with how data needed to be formatted for print work and learn a little bit about how to adjust the internal 
									programming files so that we could make changes quickly for our customers. I also began working closely with the programmers. </p>
								</p> After a few years I noticed I wasn’t being challenged as much anymore and I felt I really made a difference at ABS. So, I decided to start 
								looking into a career path that involved more with data and more with tech. This is where I started to really look into my skills and what I wanted to do. 
								I landed a job with a company that I am a huge fan of, Tesla as a Data Annotation Specialist. I learned how annotate in the 2D and 3D space. I had so much fun 
								in what I did and quickly moved up to the Chief Quality Officer role where I was able to learn even more such as confluence, SharePoint and PowerPoint. 
								I really enjoyed what I did at Tesla, but the three-hour round-trip commute took a lot of time away from my family. I moved on to a self-driving robots company 
								called Nuro. I was a Software Quality Operations Specialist where we did a lot of root cause analysis using the software Jira. Although my time was cut short 
								due to the tech layoff, I learned a lot from them.
								  </p>	
									</p>After all of that rambling here we are. During my time off I wanted to really further my knowledge and use this time to my advantage. I watched so many videos on SQL and tableau by Alex the Analyst.
								        I also took the Data Analyst Google Certification. 
									</p>I am excited to join a company as a Data Analsyt and bring my enthusiasm for data with me.</p>
